# Hi, I'm Sjors...

I'm a recently graduated computer science student from the Eindhoven University
of Technology where I graduated in massively parallel algorithms. I enjoy
figuring out how things are build and I try to document my findings on this
site.

Away from my desk I mainly enjoy working out.
